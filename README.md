# Py My Atlassian
This script allows you to extract your licenses from the MyAtlasian portal in a machine readable JSON format. Simply put your username and password in the script and run it.

## Caveats
* This is really hacky, as it scrapes the MyAtlassian page and extracts the information directly from the HTML.

## To Do
* Enable better output, maybe to a file via CLI params or as a web service returning JSON
* Caching of License data?
